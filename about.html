    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Markus Lu, I am born in Vancouver of British Columbia and moved to Richmond when I was still in elementary.
        I am currently 18 years old and I graduated from high school in June 2020 before proceeding to go to BCIT for the fall 2020 term
        for the CIT Program. I'm not much of a talker when it comes to strangers but can get pretty annoying with those I'm familiar with.
        I like taking walks in the park and enjoying the beautiful green scenary, I like playing badminton because I'm terrible at every
        other sport.</p>
    <p> Here's an interesting yet boring story about me, 
        when I was around the age of 6, I was looking out through the window as my cousin wwas walking home after school had ended. 
        She was waving at me and I stared back gleefully. When she turned the corner however, I tried sticking my head out the window
        to get a better view and...</p>
        <h3><i><b>BAM</b></i></h3> 
    <p>I had fallen out of the second floor window.</p> 
    <p>Lucky I had fallen onto the window bug screen which had fallen with me and <b>LUCKY</b> I didn't fall head first into the tall wooden fence that was basically
        one arm length away from the window I had just fallen from. After I got up, I made my way to the front door of the house but I couldn't
        reach the door bell, so I went back to where I had fallen, picked up the window bug screen, and used that to push the door bell for me.
        My grandparents were shocked, I was covered in blood, they called my parents, I went to the hospital lucky I came out unscathed except 
        for a couple of injuries, no permnanet ones... <b>I think</b>
